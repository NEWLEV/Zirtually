# Journey Map & Value Analysis

## Top Journeys

### 1. New Employee Onboarding

- **Goal**: Zero-to-productivity in < 48 hours.
- **Steps**: Login -> Dashboard Welcome -> Profile Setup -> Policy Acknowledgment -> Task Completion.
- **Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism cards for tasks, progress tracking with smooth animations.
- **Pain Points**:
  - **Generic Experience**: Welcome message isn't personalized to the specific department or industry config.
  - **Data Persistence (B-011)**: Was a major blocker; now partially resolved for critical forms.

### 2. Performance Review Cycle

- **Goal**: Fair, data-driven feedback and growth planning.
- **Steps**: Dashboard Alert -> Self-Assessment (persisted) -> Manager Review -> 1-on-1 Sync -> Goal Alignment.
- **Value Gap**: High risk of data loss on long forms without auto-save/persistence.
- **Value Gap**: Workflow engine is missing - Statuses don't reliably transition between actors (Employee -> Manager).

### 3. Lifecycle Changes (Promotion/Transfer)

- **Goal**: Seamless transition of responsibilities and access during role changes.
- **Steps**: Admin/Manager updates Role -> Org Chart reflects change -> Skill gap analysis for new role -> New training path recommended.
- **Pain Points**:
  - **Org Chart Staticity**: The `OrgChart.tsx` is current a snapshot; doesn't dynamically adapt to role changes.
  - **Skill Transfer**: Skills are manually updated; no intelligence to map previous skills to new role requirements.

### 4. HR Admin Oversight

- **Goal**: Total visibility into organizational health, performance, and compliance.
- **Steps**: KPI Dashboard Monitoring -> Real-time Audit Log Review -> Survey Deployment -> Policy Update Management.
- **Critical Value Gaps**:
  - **Hardcoded Balances**: Time-off balances are hardcoded in the UI (`TimeOff.tsx`), not driven by user employment data.
  - **Static Audit Logs**: `AuditLog.tsx` displays pre-baked mock entries. It should be consuming the `createAuditLog` events generated by user actions.
  - **Incomplete Exports**: Buttons for "Export CSV" and "Generate Report" are currently visual stubs across the platform.

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Journey     | KPI                  | Target              | Current State      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Onboarding  | Time-to-Complete     | < 48 Hours          | Mock Data Only     |
| Performance | Submission Rate      | > 95%               | Mock Data Only     |
| Admin       | Audit Coverage       | 100% of PII Access  | Static Mock        |
| Admin       | Compliance Readiness | Real-time Dashboard | Disconnected State |
| Engagement  | Pulse Participation  | > 80%               | UI Stub            |

## Must-Fix Value Gaps (Prioritized)

1.  **System-Wide Persistence (B-011)**: Roll out `useLocalStorage` or real storage to all user-input areas (Profile, Goals, Tasks).
2.  **Live Audit Logs (B-009)**: Connect the Audit Log UI to real application events (Logins, Status changes).
3.  **Data-Driven Time Off**: Replace hardcoded balances with logic based on `User` object and accrual rules.
4.  **Role-Based Data Filtering**: Ensure Managers see only their direct reports; Admins see the whole org.
