# Stakeholder Intake Summary (Simulated)

**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Facilitator:** Orchestrator Agent
**Participants:** HR (Simulated), IT (Simulated), Engineering Managers (Simulated)

## Executive Summary

We conducted a simulated intake session to identify critical gaps in the Zirtually platform for Enterprise readiness. The primary concerns revolve around **Data Portability** (HR), **Security/Compliance** (IT), and **Mobile Access** (Employees).

## 1. HR & People Operations

- **Key Insight:** Current manual entry of reviews is unsustainable for 100+ employees.
- **Requirement:** "We need a way to upload past reviews via CSV or integrate with our HRIS (BambooHR/Workday)."
- **Pain Point:** Org chart updates are too slow; need drag-and-drop hierarchy changes.

## 2. IT & Security

- **Key Insight:** The current "Mock Auth" is a major security risk.
- **Requirement:** "We mandate SSO (Single Sign-On) via Okta or Google Workspace for all internal tools."
- **Compliance:** Need an Audit Log for who viewed whose performance reviews (sensitive data access).

## 3. Engineering Managers

- **Key Insight:** "I forget to do reviews because I'm not in the tool every day."
- **Requirement:** Slack/Email notifications when a review cycle opens or is overdue.
- **Wishlist:** A "Skill Matrix" comparison view to see team gaps at a glance (Current page exists but needs comparison view).

## 4. Employees (Individual Contributors)

- **Key Insight:** "I want to check my goals on my phone during 1:1s."
- **Requirement:** Mobile-responsive layout for the Goals and Dashboard pages.

## Actions Taken

- Added **SSO Integration** to Backlog (S1).
- Added **CSV Import/Export** to Backlog (S2).
- Added **Audit Logging** to Backlog (S2).
- Added **Notification System** to Backlog (S3).
